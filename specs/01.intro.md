# OdLang

The following is my description of OdLang's ideal future, check out TODO in
README.md for the unthinkable present.

Odlang is a

* strongly statically typed
* functional programming language
* with strict evaluation,
* substructural typing
* and algebraic effects.

It is particularly useful for development of

1. desktop apps;
2. things heavily interacting with another things;
3. interpreters of non-trusted scripts.

Things to note:

* OdLang runtime has garbage collector, BUT you can still do RAII, and you
  certainly can opt out of garbage collection per-value.
* Tracking algebraic effects can be a chore, BUT they express really powerful
  concepts and can be freely composed.

## Taste of oddity

```
type String := GCString* -- unrestricted traced string

effect Dialogue where
    ask: String ->? String
    answer: String ->? ()

app := do
    let name <- ask "What's your name?"
    answer "Hello, $name!"

ioHandler: (Dialogue |= a) % m -> (IO |= a) % m :=
    | ask question continuation := do
        putStrLn question
        let response <- readLn
        ioHandler (continuation response)
    | answer response cont := do
        putStrLn response
        ioHandler (cont ())

main: IO |= () := ioHandler app

parrot: (Dialogue |= a) -> List String ! -> (a, List String !) :=
    | return x, xs := (x, xs)
    | ask q, nil := continue q nil
    | ask _, x :: xs := continue x xs
    | answer x, xs := continue () (x :: xs)

infixr monoidal ::

data List a :=
    | nil
    | a :: List a

foldr (f : (a -> b -> b) *) (s : b) : List a -> b :=
    | nil := s
    | x :: xs := f x ~(foldr f s xs)

map (f : (a -> b) *) : List a % m -> List b % m :=
    flip foldr nil | x ys := f x :: ys

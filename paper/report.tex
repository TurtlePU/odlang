\chapter*{Abstract}

We propose a new programming language where algebraic effects are visible to the
substructural type system as polymorphic effect types. This report includes a
high-level specification of a surface language along with description of
procedures that translate it into OdLang Core, a small explicitly typed
interpreted language.

Мы предлагаем новый язык программирования с субструктурной систе\-мой типов, в
которой алгебраические эффекты представлены полиморфны\-ми типами эффектов.
Данный отчёт содержит высокоуровневую специфи\-кацию языка вместе с описанием
процедур трансляции этого языка в OdLang Core, маленький явно типизированный
интерпретируемый язык.

\chapter{Introduction}

This is part of a project in the area of programming language design. We aim to
develop a new functional language featuring a modern type system for ergonomic
management of side effects and program resources.

Simply put, side effects are everything a program does to the environment:
device management, reads from / writes to files, missile launches, etc.
Programming errors in this area range from embarrassing bugs to outright
catastrophes; every substantial development team wants to be sure that these
errors never happen. However, existing mainstream programming techniques such as
testing and code review are unsound, which means that you can never be sure that
there are no bugs even if all tests have passed.

Luckily, there is a sound method known to every seasoned programmer: type system
expressive enough to statically represent invariants you wish to uphold. In this
project, we implement a new language with effect types representing computations
that influence its environment. The idea is not novel: there are research
languages Unison \cite{unison} and Koka \cite{koka} on this topic; a simpler and
somewhat more tractable model is studied in \cite{bauer}. Our innovation is in
the usage of a substructural type system to statically verify that continuations
in effect handlers are called an appropriate number of times. A concept for such
combination is folklore and mentioned in \cite{folklore}; this project properly
expands on the topic.

In the previous line of work, we decided to split the language in two layers:
a surface language, OdLang, to write programs in and a core language, OdLang
Core, to check types and interpret expressions. We also described logical rules
for the core language; this report includes a short recap of Core's most
important features. In the main part of this paper we come up with syntactic
rules of OdLang as well as with algorithms for translating it into OdLang Core,
including multiplicity elision rules, implicit quantification, bidirectional
type checking, desugaring of multiplicity constraints and effect types and,
finally, desugaring of terms.

\chapter{Literature Review}

The point of pure functional programming is to give a programmer precise control
over side effects that happen during program execution. The consensus is to use
special kinds of monads, notable examples being monad transformers \cite{mtl},
free monads \cite{free} and, most recently, freer monads. The last ones in
conjunction with heterogeneous lists give rise to the Extensible Effects
approach \cite{exteff} which, as claimed by the authors, overcomes the drawbacks
of previous tools. However, these techniques are rarely used outside of Haskell
because they require quite advanced type-level machinery which is simply not
available in other, either more simple or mainstream, languages.

Albeit surprisingly, the key concept behind Extensible Effects is simple. It is
to view an effect as an interaction between a sub-expression and a central
authority that handles effect execution. Languages with algebraic effects, for
their part, capitalize on this idea and provide built-in language primitives to
build both such sub-expressions --- from now on, we will call them
``procedures'' --- and central authorities, ``handlers''. Communication between
them is done via continuation-passing \cite{algeff}.

For example, Multicore OCaml has a way to declare new effects as well as a
builtin function \verb|perform| to, indeed, \textit{perform} an effect
\cite{ocaml}. Handler is just a regular \verb|case| statement that
pattern-matches on performed effects. However, for a long time effects were
invisible to OCaml's type system; this means that every function could be a
procedure executing arbitrary effects, which is in no way different from
the mainstream approach.

As for Unison, they introduce proper effect types in the form of attributes on
the function type. However, they do not restrict how many times a continuation
is called in a handler \cite{unrestricted}, which may lead to bizarre and
unexpected behavior of a program, just like a program in C which uses
\verb|fork|. Koka's treatment of continuations is only slightly better as they
do not let a programmer access continuation directly, which enables them (and
makes them) to introduce a whole lot of ad-hoc mechanisms to make both behavior
and performance of programs more predictable \cite{hidden}.

A more disciplined solution is offered in \cite{bauer}. The authors of Runners
in Action simplify the framework by forcing continuations to be in tail-call
positions, effectively replacing continuation with a simple \verb|return|
statement (pun intended). However, it makes certain effects inexpressible, most
notably nondeterminism and asynchrony.

We get rid of the tradeoffs mentioned above by embracing a substructural type
system. In its setting, every value can have two constraints imposed on its
usage: can it be silently dropped? Can it be copied? We simply make a programmer
specify the constraints for continuations while declaring new effects. As a
bonus, these constraints can be later used by an optimizing compiler to place
values outside of the garbage-collected heap.

Actually, there already are a few different substructural type systems.
Linear Types extension in Haskell \cite{linear} and unique types in Rust
\cite{rust} are the most well-known examples, although we take a slightly
different approach which is extensively described in \cite{ural}. As of our
current knowledge, this project is the first to utilize URAL for language with
algebraic effects.

\chapter{OdLang Core}

Before diving into syntactic richness of a surface language, let us recap the
most important bits about core language.

\section{Kinds}

OdLang Core is a dialect of System $F_\omega$. It has six kinds: substructural
multiplicities, rows (type-level dictionaries) of any kind, pretypes (algebraic
data types, function types), types (pretypes with a specified multiplicity),
type-level pairs and operators (type-level functions between kinds). (Pre)types
can be equirecursive, for this we adapt an algorithm described in \cite{stone}.

In addition to the expected operations, we introduce a way to apply type
operator of kind $k \to k'$ to the row of kind ``row $k$'', yielding an
expression of kind ``row $k'$''. This way ``row'' can be perceived as a
kind-level functor.

Precise kinding rules for type-level calculus are given in \ref{typelevel}.

            {k \; \text{kind}}
            {K,\; a :: k \;\vdash\; a :: k}
            \textsc{KVar} \and
        \inferrule
            {k, k' \; \text{kind} \\ K \;\vdash\; x :: k
                \\ K \;\vdash\; t \;::\; k \to k'}
            {K \;\vdash\; t \; x :: k'}
            \textsc{KApp} \and
        \inferrule
            {k, k' \; \text{kind} \\ K,\; a :: k \;\vdash\; b :: k'}
            {K \;\vdash\; (a :: k .\; b) :: k \to k'}
            \textsc{KAbs} \and
        \inferrule
            {K \;\vdash\; a :: k \\ K \;\vdash\; b :: k'}
            {K \;\vdash\; \langle a, b \rangle :: k \times k'}

                \\ K \;\vdash\; t \;::\; k \to k'}
            {K \;\vdash\; t \;@\; r \;::\; \text{row} \; k'}
            \textsc{KMap} \and
    \end{mathpar}

\section{Multiplicities}

Multiplicities form a distributive lattice on four elements:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{U}nrestricted ($*$) --- values of such types can be left
        unused and can be arbitrarily copied;
    \item \textbf{R}elevant ($+$) --- cannot be left unused;
    \item \textbf{A}ffine ($?$) --- cannot be copied, but can be left unused;
    \item \textbf{L}inear ($!$) --- must be used exactly once.
\end{itemize}

Multiplicity literals draw an analogy with the notation of regular expressions.
We can also join constraints of two multiplicities using $\lor$ and take common
constraints using $\land$. Multiplicity polymorphism is present, too.

\section{Row types}

As it has been mentioned before, rows are type-level dictionaries. To refine on
this statement: rows of kind ``row $k$'' are \textit{multi}-maps from field
names to type-level expressions of kind $k$. We can declare row literals as well
as row variables (that is, we have row polymorphism) and join rows together.
However, there is no polymorphism over field names.

\section{Pretypes}

Pretypes include simple functions as well as \verb|forall| binders for different
kinds of polymorphism. In addition, any row of types $R$ can be turned into an
algebraic data type:

\begin{itemize}
    \item $\{\dots R\}$ is a record of values in $R$. To construct a value of
        record type is to provide all its fields, to use the record is to use
        all its fields.
    \item $[\dots R]$ is a list of alternatives listed in $R$. To construct it
        is to provide all its fields built from the same context, to use it is
        to choose one of alternatives.
    \item $(|\dots R|)$ is a tagged union of options listed in $R$. To construct
        it is to construct one of the options, to use it is to pattern-match on
        it and describe how to use every option.
\end{itemize}

Precise typing rules are given in Fig.\ref{terms-1}-\ref{terms-2}.

\chapter{Surface language}

OdLang itself is a syntactic extension over its core incorporating a new kind
(kind of effects), a new type constructor (effectful computation), nominal types
and a few features revolving around recursion and pattern-matching. Last but not
least, while core language is typed explicitly, surface language has a few
tweaks to reduce amount of type annotations and improve their readability.

\section{Type-level quality of life improvements}

Here we list more or less expected and conventional features of a modern
functional programming language along with novel pieces of syntactic sugar.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Core has only type-level pairs. However, OdLang has arbitrary nonempty
        and nonsingular type-level tuples:
\begin{verbatim}
tuple Quadruple : type * multiplicity * pretype * type :=
    < {}*, !, String, String? >
\end{verbatim}
        Desugaring is trivial: \verb|*| is a right-associative \verb|x|;
        components of tuples are folded with \verb|<_,_>| from right to left.

        To access components of a type-level tuple, one can pattern-match on it:
\begin{verbatim}
tuple < _, _, Third, _ >
    : type * multiplicity * pretype * type
    := Quadruple
\end{verbatim}
        Desugaring is also trivial and involves repeated applications of
        \verb|snd| and one application of \verb|fst| for each component except
        for the last.
    \item Using type-level \verb|fix| explicitly is cumbersome. One can build a
        dependency graph of type-level expressions and use \verb|fix| for
        strongly connected components. The same approach is used on the term
        level for recursive functions and was originally described in [SPJ].

        Before desugaring:
\begin{verbatim}
type Fix (f : type -> type) := f (Fix f)

type Red := { head : Int*, tail : (() -> Blue)* }*
type Blue := { head : Int*, tail : (() -> Red)* }*
\end{verbatim}
        After desugaring:
\begin{verbatim}
type Fix (f : type -> type) := (fix t : type . f t)

tuple <Red, Blue> : type * type :=
    (fix <r, b> : type * type . <
        { head : Int*, tail : (() -> b)* }*,
        { head : Int*, tail : (() -> r)* }*,
    >)
\end{verbatim}
    \item In most cases, kind of operator and forall arguments can be inferred
        from its usage in the resulting expression:
\begin{verbatim}
pretype Beside f r := {...r, ...(f @ r)}
    -- r is inferred to be a row of types
    -- f is inferred to be a (type -> type) operator
\end{verbatim}
        The case where inference fails can be seen above, in \verb|Fix| case,
        because \verb|f| can be kinded as \verb|pretype -> pretype|, too.

        To perform said kind inference, one can utilize a standard unification
        algorithm [HM].
    \item Following convention in Haskell, we can forbid lowercase type-level
        entities and assume that every lowercase name in a type is an argument
        of a forall binder.
    \item Omnipresent multiplicity annotations obscure type annotations.
        However, certain annotations can be omit. For example, annotations on a
        record and on nearly all arrows are elided here:
\begin{verbatim}
type Fmap f m := forall a b. (a -> b) % m -> f a -> f b

pair : a -> b -> { fst: a, snd: b } :=
    | x, y := { fst: x, snd: y }
\end{verbatim}
        Following typing rules, we can only generate constraints on annotations,
        but not annotations themselves. Therefore we cannot infer them, but we
        can introduce sane defaults for common cases, as is done with lifetime
        annotations in Rust [rust]. We propose two elision rules:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item For arrow and forall types, choose the most permissive
                annotation;
            \item For algebraic data types, introduce a new annotation variable.
        \end{enumerate}
        Applying elision rules to the expressions above, we get:
\begin{verbatim}
type Fmap f m := (forall a. (forall b.
    ((a -> b) % m -> (f a -> f b) % m)*
)*)*

pair : (forall a. (forall b . (forall m .
    (a -> (
        b -> { fst: a, snd: b } % (m \/ mult a \/ mult b)
    ) % mult a)*
)*)*)* :=
    ...
\end{verbatim}
    \item OdLang Core allows records, but not tuples. Tuples in surface language
        are encoded using a record type of sufficient arity:
\begin{verbatim}
type Tuple4 a b c d := { n1: a, n2: b, n3: c, n4: d }
\end{verbatim}
        Instead of doing this, we could represent tuples as nested pairs, but
        this representation does not bring any immediate benefits.
    \item OdLang Core does not have a way to constrain multiplicities. However,
        we can use \verb|/\| to relax constraints multiplicities impose
        themselves:
\begin{verbatim}
dup : [a <= +] -> a -> (a, a) :=
    | x -> (x, x)

dup' : a % (m /\ +) -> (a % (m /\ +), a % (m /\ +)) :=
    | x -> (x, x)
\end{verbatim}
\end{enumerate}

\section{Effect types, effect polymorphism}

As you might remember, the biggest hurdle of this project is trying to
incorporate algebraic effects into a sound substructural type system. We start
with introducing a new kind, \verb|effect|:

\begin{verbatim}
effect State s where
    modifyState: (s -> s)! ->! {}*

effect Generator t where
    yield: t ->! {}*
\end{verbatim}

Effect is a list of operations a corresponding computation can do. From
imperative point of view, each operation is a side-effectful function.
Multiplicity annotation after its arrow describes an amount of times a control
flow might return to the point where operation was called.

Effects can be joined using a comma operator: \\
\verb|State (List t), Generator t|.

Denoting the type of a computation requiring effect \verb|e| and yielding a
result of type \verb|a| as \verb+e |= a+, let us describe the desugaring of
effects into Core language.

Effects themselves are rows of triples \verb|type * multiplicity * type|:

\begin{verbatim}
row State s where
    modifyState: < (s -> s)!, !, {}* >

row Generator t where
    yield: < t, !, {}* >
\end{verbatim}

Therefore joining effects is the same as joining rows. In addition, effect
polymorphism becomes a special case of row polymorphism.

Given an effect row \verb|e| and a type \verb|a|, \verb+|=+ is best described
as an operator:

\begin{verbatim}
type intoEntry rec <from, m, to> :=
    (from, (to -> rec % (m \/ mult to)) % m)

pretype (e |= a) := (|
    pure: a,
    ...(intoEntry (e |= a) @ e)
|)
\end{verbatim}

\section{Term-level quality of life improvements}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Named functions admit a more compact declaration:
\begin{verbatim}
pair : a -> b -> { fst: a, snd: b } :=
    | x, y := { fst: x, snd: y }

pair' (x : a) (y : b) : { fst: a, snd: b } :=
    { fst: x, snd: y }
\end{verbatim}
    \item Lambda expressions followed by a \verb|case| statement admit a more
        compact declaration:
\begin{verbatim}
type List a m := (|
    Nil: {} % m
    Cons: (a, List a m) % (m \/ mult a)
|) % (m \/ mult a)

foldr (f : a -> b -> b) (s : b) : List a m -> b :=
    | xs := case xs of
        Nil _ := s
        Cons (x, xs) := f x (foldr f s xs)

foldr' (f : a -> b -> b) (s : b) : List a m -> b :=
    | Nil _ := s
    | Cons (x, xs) := f x (foldr' f s xs)
\end{verbatim}
\end{enumerate}

\section{Bidirectional type checking}

\textbf{Results}

It is expected to will have implemented an interpreter of the language described
above, including the split in the surface and core languages: logical rules of
the core language are already properly written out, and the Haskell ecosystem
has all the necessary tools.

Type inference and the existence of principal types in the surface language are
highly anticipated because both row types and substructural types play nicely
with Hindley-Milner. However, general equirecursive types may pose a threat to
the type inference, therefore they might be hidden beneath the surface.

\textbf{Conclusion}

Utilising the recent advancements in type theory, we developed a polished model
of computations with side effects which is an improvement upon analogues in
terms of soundness and, theoretically, performance. While doing so, we made
initially unrelated constructs from different type systems interplay nicely: row
polymorphism with substructural typing, both type-level pairs and row
polymorphism with algebraic effects... In addition, we saved ourselves the
headache of developing a dedicated runtime for algebraic effects using a
well-typed encoding into continuation-passing style.

The most notable limitation of our solution is that core language is hardly
extensible: generalized algebraic data types cannot be easily fit into it;
coexistence of dependent types with substructural types is still an ongoing
research topic;... To overcome this limitation, we can make use of the
two-layered architecture of the language and change core language independently
from the surface to incorporate new features.

Nevertheless, as it was said in the beginning, the primary goals after this
project are to formally verify the soundness of the type system and to write a
self-hosting compiler. The first one is needed primarily to exclude the human
factor; writing a compiler is required to fulfill promises of performance.

Designing one more programming language might not change anything in the grand
scheme of things; however, in order to reach the ideal future where every
programmer writes programs in languages with effect types, we as a whole
programming community need enough failed attempts to learn from and working
alternatives to choose from.
